1) JavaScript execution context

    consider the following program 

    var a = 2;
    function sqaure(num){
        var ans = num * num;
        return ans;
    }
    var squre2 = sqaure(a);
    var squre4 = sqaure(4);

    executionContext has two parts that is
    memory and code 
    in first phase of the execution a, sqaure2 and squre4 memory allocated with undefined values
    and squre memory allocated with function code 

    in second phase of the execution
    for functtion squre execution of square2 create separate execution context and ans with undefined values
    same for squre4  

    this is called as callstack/machine stack etc .
    first phase of the execution is global phase and other execution context is pushed and poped it according to need
